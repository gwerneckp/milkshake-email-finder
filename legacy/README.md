# Legacy Directory
This directory contains the legacy versions of the email generator script. The original PHP script was written by my father, Ricardo Paiva, in 2005 as a tool to help him find the email of a book author he wanted to contact. He noticed that emails are often crafted using similar rules and decided to use a script to try to find the author's email. To his surprise, it actually worked!

I found the PHP script in 2022 on an old pen drive and asked my father about it. He told me the story and I thought it was quite ingenious, so I decided to reimplement it in Typescript to make it easier to integrate with web apps. Later, I decided to rewrite the script from scratch in Python.
